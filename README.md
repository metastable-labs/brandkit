The primary lockup Moblocs is built to exist in Motion Green, but you can use Space Black to maintain high contrast on a light background. On dark backgrounds with a greyscale spectrum, opt for the white version.  The logo mark and the full lockup can be used interchangeably, but higher preference should be given to the full lockup and the logo mark should be used in smaller applications. The token should be used standalone and not merged with the lockup. 

To maintain a high level of consistency, no edits should be made to the logo files; no shadows, outlines, skewing or combining the logo with other icons.
